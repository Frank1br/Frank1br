<h2 align="center">👩‍💻 About Me</h2>

<p align="left">
  Hello, everyone! My name is Frank Oliveira, and I’m a passionate developer! 🚀<br><br>
  I started coding when I was 16, but my interest in technology goes way back to my childhood. Since then, I've been diving deep into coding, solving bugs, and continuously learning.  
  <br><br>
  Currently, I’m working on my first major project, where I’m using Flutter for the front-end and PHP for the back-end. This experience has been challenging, but it has helped me grow as a developer, improving my problem-solving skills and ability to handle real-world projects.  
  <br><br>
  If you want to know more about me, feel free to connect through my social media! 😊
</p>
